# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

ðŸ’¡ **Concept:** A well-documented EDA process is essential for collaboration, reproducibility, and ethical transparency in classification projects.

---

## Executive Summary

The dataset contains **4,025 records across 8 features** (7 numeric, 1 categorical). No missing values were found, and the dataset appears ready for modeling. Class balance shows notable variation across `tree_type`, which may influence model performance. Several numeric variables (e.g., `dbh`, `age`, `average_height`) show strong relationships with the target.

## Data Provenance

- **Source:** Provided dataset (likely yield tables for tree species).
- **Version:** Single version, ~4,025 rows.
- **License/Access:** Not explicitly stated in notebook; verify before external use.
- **Restrictions:** None documented; check for forestry data licensing requirements.

---

## Class Distribution

- **Target variable:** `tree_type`
- Appears imbalanced across species. Some tree types dominate the dataset.
- Visualization in notebook: class balance plots show skew, requiring balancing strategies (e.g., SMOTE, stratified sampling).

---

## Variable Summaries

- **Numerical variables:**

  - `yield_class`, `age`, `average_height`, `dbh`, `trees_per_ha`, `basal_area`
  - Distribution: mostly continuous, some skew (e.g., `trees_per_ha`).
  - Central tendencies well-documented with `.describe()`

- **Categorical:**
  - `tree_type` â€“ multiple classes, imbalanced

---

## Key Correlations & Feature Insights

- **Chi-square tests** show significant associations between `tree_type` and all major numeric predictors (`age`, `dbh`, `average_height`, etc.) with very low p-values (< 1e-50).
- Correlation heatmap indicates redundancy between `average_height`, `dbh`, and `basal_area`.
- Early insight: `dbh` and `average_height` are strong candidates for predictive features.

---

## Missing Values & Outliers

- **Missing values:** None detected (`Non-Null Count` = 4025 for all columns).
- **Outliers:** Some extreme values in `trees_per_ha` and `basal_area` spotted. Notebook mentions Isolation Forest/boxplots; should confirm before modeling.

---

## Ethical & Licensing Notes

- **Bias risk:** Imbalanced classes may bias the classifier towards majority tree types.
- **Data source transparency:** Ensure dataset aligns with open-use licensing.
- **Environmental/Policy context:** Data may be used in forestry management; ensure outputs are not misapplied outside ecological scope.

## Next-Step Recommendations

1. **Feature Engineering**

   - Normalize skewed variables (`trees_per_ha`, `basal_area`).
   - Explore interactions (`dbh Ã— age`, `average_height / age`).

2. **Class Balance**

   - Apply stratified sampling or oversampling (SMOTE) for minority classes.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**

   - Consider PCA/t-SNE to detect latent structure.

4. **Model Preparation**
   - Standardize numeric features; encode `tree_type`.
   - Reserve validation strategy (stratified k-fold).
