# Compliance Report

## Regulatory & Privacy Constraints – AI Risk Flow

### Regulatory Flow

This project automates annual MRV for Improved Forest Management (IFM) carbon projects using LiDAR and remote sensing data. The domain falls under **environmental monitoring**, which is classified as **limited risk** in the EU AI Act (2024 draft). This tier requires transparency and disclosure but does not impose the extensive obligations mandated for high-risk domains such as medical diagnosis or biometric identification.

### Risk Tier Mapping (EU AI Act, 2024 Draft)

| Domain                    | Risk Tier   | Relevance to Project       |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Environmental monitoring  | **Limited** | ✅ This project’s category |
| Medical diagnosis support | High        | Not applicable             |
| Biometric identification  | Prohibited  | Not applicable             |

### Compliance Obligations

- **Transparency**: All stakeholders (forest owners, project developers, auditors) must be informed about the model’s scope and limitations.
- **Disclosure**: Geographic coverage (Central Europe) and potential biases must be clearly communicated.
- **Ethical Use**: Results are advisory and must be verified against certification standards (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard).

### Planned Compliance Steps

- Document all model assumptions, limitations, and data provenance.
- Provide stakeholders with clear reporting dashboards including accuracy and confidence levels.
- Include disclaimers where results should not be extrapolated outside Central Europe.
- Establish a governance process with human oversight for credit issuance.
