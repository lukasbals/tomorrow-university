# About this project

## Problem

How does land use change and wild fires influence the total carbon emissions?

## Variables

- Dependent Variable (Target): Total carbon emissions in tons per year
- Independent Variables (Features): Land use change emissions, wild fires emissions

## Datasets

Source: [Agri-food CO2 emission dataset - Forecasting ML](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml)

Description: A comprehensive dataset on agricultural CO2 emissions, merging data from the FAO and IPCC, was constructed. The dataset, analysed in a notebook, highlights the agri-food sectorâ€™s significant contribution to global emissions, emphasising the importance of addressing its environmental impact for climate change mitigation.

Why this dataset: It's well known and structured. Free and easy to use as it's already cleaned up, structured, and a time series dataset - ideal for regression analysis.

## How to run

Create a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the Python environment:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Ethics

### Data source

The data for this project is sourced from the [Agri-food CO2 emission dataset - Forecasting ML](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml) dataset on Kaggle. This dataset contains information on CO2 emissions associated with different types of land use and meat consumption.

### License

This project is licensed under the CC0: Public Domain - see the [LICENSE](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

### Known Biases

The dataset may reflect biases inherent in the data collection process, such as regional differences in reporting standards or agricultural practices. Additionally, the focus on CO2 emissions may overlook other significant environmental impacts, such as biodiversity loss or water usage.

### Consent/Privacy

The dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) and is considered safe for use in research and analysis. However, users should be aware of the potential for re-identification in aggregated data.

### Limitations

- The dataset may not capture all factors influencing methane and carbon emissions, such as agricultural practices or technological advancements.
- The analysis is limited to the available data and may not generalize to other contexts or regions.
- Potential inaccuracies in the data could affect the model's predictions and insights.
