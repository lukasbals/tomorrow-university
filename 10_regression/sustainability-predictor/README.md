# About this project

## Problem

How does land use change and meat consumption influence the pollution of methane and carbon?

## Variables

- Dependent Variable (Target): Methane and carbon emissions in tons per year
- Independent Variables (Features): Land use change in square kilometers, meat consumption in tons

## Datasets

Source: [EDGAR Food Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/edgarfoodemissions?resource=download)

Description: This dataset contains information on food-related greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and carbon emissions associated with different types of land use and meat consumption.

Why this dataset: It's well known and structured. Free and easy to use as it's already cleaned up, structured, and a time series dataset - ideal for regression analysis.
